This project contains multiple simulation projects in Geant4 with the NCrystal software implemented. Some branches are used to replicate experiments such as measuring cross sections and transmission ratios. Other branches are different versions of my thermal neutron source design. NCrystal needs to be installed in the Geant4 source folder for this to function properly. The thermal neutron source includesa polyethelyne box, a sapphire crystal, and a test jar of argon placed next to in. The DetectorConstruction files contain all parameters of the geometry.
